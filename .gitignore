# .gitignore — Files that Git should NOT track
# =============================================================================
# WHY .gitignore?
# Some files are generated during the build process and should NOT be
# committed to Git. They're machine-specific, large, or reproducible.
# =============================================================================

# These appear if you accidentally run cmake in the source directory
